##Description

StrangerDanger is first and foremost a safety app. Say you’re walking home alone from a night out at the bars. It’s dark and you can’t shake the feeling that someone’s watching or following you. You fear for your safety and want to notify loved ones of where you are so they can help take the appropriate measures. With this app, at the push of a button you can notify all of your In-Case-of-Emergency (ICE) contacts with a personalized message (1) indicating that you are worried about your safety and (2) providing them with a GPS link to your exact location which they can open up in Google Maps. Additionally if you’re currently being attacked and can’t easily get to the app, rapidly shaking your smartphone will also send out alerts.
